## random module in Python.

The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. Perhaps the most important thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.

### When to use it

We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc. When making your password database more secure or powering a random page feature of your website

### Random functions

The Random module contains some very useful functions.

**Randint**
for generate random int
accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number.

**Random**
Random number between 0 ,1
for a larger number, just multiply it.

**Choice**
Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.

**Shuffle**
The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

**Randrange**
Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

## Risk Analysis in Software Testing 

In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

## Why use Risk Analysis?

In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas.

After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks.

When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

### possible risks that you could encounter

* Use of new hardware
* Use of new technology
* Use of new automation tool
* The sequence of code
* Availability of test resources for the application

### certain risks that are unavoidable.

1. The time that you allocated for testing

2. A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application

3. Urgency from the clients to deliver the project

4. Incomplete requirements

5. In such cases, you have to tackle the situation with care. Following points can be taken care of:

6. Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting

7. Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas

8. Create a Risk Assessment database for future use

9. Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators:

    * **High**: means the effect of the risk would be very high and non-tolerable. The company might face loss.

    * **Medium**: it is tolerable but not desirable. The company may suffer financially but there is a limited risk.

    * **Low**: it is tolerable. There lies little or no external exposure or no financial loss.

10. Risk Identification
    * **Business Risks**: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

    * **Testing Risks**: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

    * **Premature Release Risk**: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

    * **Software Risks**: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process

11. The perspective of Risk Assessment
    * **Effect**
    * **Cause**
    * **Likelihood**
